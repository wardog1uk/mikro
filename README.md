# Mikro Assembler

## Introduction

The Mikro Assembler is a cartridge released by Supersoft for the Commodore 64/VIC 20 in the early 1980s. It was written by and is copyright Andrew J Trott.

It provides an assembler which allows you to write assembly code in the same way as you write BASIC code. This allows you to LOAD, SAVE and VERIFY the code to disk or tape.

It also adds a machine code monitor called TIM.
